            We are TDI Group, a specialized agency focused entirely on the
            post-development journey of tech products. We don't just run ads; we build
            ecosystems. We understand the nuances of SaaS retention, app adoption
            hooks, and marketplace network effects. Our team combines strategic
            insight, creative execution, and a relentless focus on driving engagement
            and measurable business outcomes.
