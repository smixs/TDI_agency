# Task ID: 9
# Title: SEO and Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the site is optimized for search engines and performance.
# Details:
Verify semantic HTML usage (single h1, proper h2/h3 hierarchy, semantic tags like nav, section, article). Add meaningful alt texts to all images. Generate sitemap.xml (automatically or statically). Create basic robots.txt allowing indexing. Optimize all images using next/image or manual optimization (WebP format, compression). Run Lighthouse checks focusing on Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO metrics. Address any issues found.

# Test Strategy:
Run Lighthouse audits in Chrome DevTools. Verify HTML semantics with accessibility tools. Check image loading performance. Validate sitemap.xml and robots.txt. Test site with screen readers for accessibility.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Semantic HTML Structure and Image Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure proper HTML semantics and optimize all images for better performance and accessibility
### Details:
Review and update HTML structure to follow semantic guidelines: use a single h1 per page, establish proper h2/h3 hierarchy, and implement semantic tags (nav, section, article, etc.). Add meaningful alt text to all images for accessibility and SEO. Implement image optimization using next/image component for Next.js projects or manually convert images to WebP format with appropriate compression. Verify image lazy loading is enabled where appropriate.

## 2. Generate SEO Essential Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create necessary files for search engine crawling and indexing
### Details:
Generate a sitemap.xml file that includes all important pages of the website. This can be done automatically using a library like next-sitemap for Next.js projects or manually for static sites. Create a robots.txt file at the root level that allows search engines to index the site while specifying any necessary exclusions. Ensure both files are accessible at their standard URLs (/sitemap.xml and /robots.txt). Verify meta tags (title, description) are properly implemented on all pages.

## 3. Run Performance Audits and Implement Improvements [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Conduct comprehensive performance testing and address identified issues
### Details:
Run Lighthouse audits in Chrome DevTools focusing on all four key metrics: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. Document scores and identified issues. Address performance issues such as render-blocking resources, excessive JavaScript, or unoptimized CSS. Fix accessibility problems including contrast issues, missing ARIA attributes, or keyboard navigation problems. Implement best practices like HTTPS usage, proper error handling, and responsive design. Resolve any remaining SEO issues not addressed in previous subtasks. Conduct a final audit to verify improvements and document the results.
