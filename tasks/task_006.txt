# Description: Implement the differentiators section and approach/process visualization.
# Details:
For Why TDI: Create section with heading "The TDI Difference". Implement list of 6 advantages with Icon, Title, and Short Description for each. Arrange in 2-3 columns using CSS Grid. For Process: Create section with heading "Your Growth Journey, Simplified". Visualize 4-step process using either numbered list with stylized numbers or horizontal/vertical timeline graphic.

For each of the 6 advantage items: 1) Select appropriate icons from the site's icon library, 2) Add titles and short descriptions for each advantage, 3) Style each item with consistent spacing, typography, and hover effects if applicable. The advantages should highlight TDI's unique value propositions. Ensure each item has proper semantic HTML structure and is accessible. Test the responsive behavior to ensure the grid layout works correctly at different breakpoints.

Each step should include a concise title and brief description. Ensure the visualization is responsive, maintains visual hierarchy, and guides the user's eye through the sequence. Focus on simplicity and clarity in the design, using appropriate spacing, colors, and typography to enhance readability.
