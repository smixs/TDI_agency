# Task ID: 8
# Title: Footer and Animation Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the footer component and add animations/interactivity throughout the site.
# Details:
For Footer: Create simple component with Logo, Copyright, Links (Privacy, Terms), and optional social media icons. For Animations: Add subtle hover effects to all interactive elements (buttons, links, service cards, process items). Integrate framer-motion or Intersection Observer API for scroll animations. Apply fade-in and slide-up animations to sections or major elements when they enter viewport. Keep animations quick (0.3-0.5s), gentle (ease-out easing), and selective (don't animate everything).

# Test Strategy:
Test footer on all screen sizes. Verify hover effects work consistently. Check that scroll animations trigger at appropriate times. Test animation performance on lower-end devices. Validate that animations don't interfere with content consumption.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Footer Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a responsive footer component with all required elements
### Details:
Create a footer component that includes: 1) Company logo (use the existing logo asset), 2) Copyright text with current year, 3) Links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages, 4) Social media icons with appropriate hover states. Ensure the footer is responsive and maintains proper spacing across all device sizes. Use flexbox for layout and implement consistent styling with the rest of the site. Position the footer at the bottom of every page.

## 2. Implement Interactive Element Hover Effects [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add subtle hover animations to all interactive elements throughout the site
### Details:
Add hover effects to all interactive elements including: 1) Navigation links, 2) Buttons (primary and secondary), 3) Service cards, 4) Process items, 5) Footer links and social icons. Use CSS transitions with duration between 0.3-0.5s and ease-out easing. For buttons, implement subtle scale (1.05) and shadow changes. For cards, add slight elevation effect. For links, use color transitions and possibly underline animations. Ensure all hover states provide clear visual feedback without being distracting.

## 3. Implement Scroll-Based Animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Add entrance animations to page sections when they enter the viewport
### Details:
Integrate Framer Motion or Intersection Observer API to create scroll-triggered animations. Apply fade-in and slide-up animations to: 1) Section headings, 2) Service cards, 3) Process steps, 4) Testimonial blocks, 5) CTA sections. Configure animations with: duration of 0.3-0.5s, ease-out easing, appropriate delay between elements (50-100ms), and threshold settings to trigger when elements are 10-20% in viewport. Implement a reusable animation component/hook that can be applied consistently across the site. Ensure animations only play once per page visit and don't interfere with scrolling performance.

## 4. Implement Back to Top Button [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a smooth scrolling "Back to Top" button that appears when users scroll down the page
### Details:
Implement a "Back to Top" button component that appears after scrolling down a certain threshold. The button should include smooth animation for appearance/disappearance and scroll behavior. The button should be fixed in position (typically bottom-right), have appropriate styling consistent with the site's design, and include keyboard accessibility.
