      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Global Setup and Structure Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Global Setup and Structure Configuration task into 5 specific subtasks that cover metadata updates, font configuration, CSS setup, Tailwind configuration, and page structure implementation with clear acceptance criteria for each.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical configurations across different files (layout.tsx, globals.css, tailwind.config.ts, page.tsx) and requires understanding of Next.js structure, Tailwind, and CSS fundamentals. The complexity comes from establishing the foundation that will affect all other components."
    },

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Header Component Enhancement",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Header Component Enhancement task into 6 subtasks covering logo integration, mobile menu implementation with shadcn/ui, animation effects, scroll styling, navigation link configuration, and responsive testing across breakpoints.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing interactive elements (mobile menu), animations, and scroll effects while ensuring responsive behavior. The complexity is elevated by the need to integrate third-party components (shadcn/ui) and ensure proper navigation functionality."
    },

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Hero Section Refinement",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Hero Section Refinement task into 5 subtasks covering background design with gradients/SVG patterns, parallax animation implementation, icon integration for key pillars, card styling enhancements, and responsive layout testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves visual design work, animation implementation, and responsive layout challenges. The parallax effect and card styling with hover effects add complexity, requiring both CSS expertise and animation knowledge."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Client Logos and Existing Components Polish",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Client Logos and Existing Components Polish task into 4 subtasks covering logo asset preparation and integration, responsive logo display implementation, Market Challenge component typography and visual enhancements, and About TDI component layout and content refinement.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves refining existing components rather than building from scratch, making it moderately complex. The main challenges are optimizing images, ensuring responsive behavior for logos, and implementing the two-column layout for the About section."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Services Section Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Services Section Implementation task into 6 subtasks covering ServiceCard component design, hover effect implementation, ServicesGrid component creation, data structure definition, responsive grid layout implementation, and section heading styling.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating reusable components with complex styling (gradients, hover effects) and implementing a responsive grid system. The complexity comes from building both individual cards and the grid container while ensuring they work together seamlessly across screen sizes."
    },

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Why TDI and Process Sections",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Why TDI and Process Sections task into 5 subtasks covering Why TDI section layout and heading, advantage item component design, responsive column arrangement, Process section heading and layout, and process visualization implementation (timeline or numbered list).",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating two distinct sections with different visual approaches. The complexity lies in designing the process visualization (timeline or numbered steps) and implementing responsive column layouts for the advantages list."
    },

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Results Highlights and Contact CTA Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Results Highlights and Contact CTA Implementation task into 7 subtasks covering results section layout and heading, case snippet component design, contact section layout and heading, form component implementation with shadcn/ui, form validation setup with react-hook-form and zod, form submission configuration, and responsive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks due to the form implementation with validation and submission handling. It requires integrating multiple libraries (shadcn/ui, react-hook-form, zod) and setting up serverless functions for form processing, along with designing case snippet components."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Footer and Animation Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Footer and Animation Implementation task into 6 subtasks covering footer component design and layout, hover effect implementation for interactive elements, scroll animation setup with framer-motion or Intersection Observer, fade-in and slide-up animation implementation, animation timing and easing configuration, and performance testing for animations.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines straightforward footer implementation with more complex animation work. The complexity comes from implementing scroll-triggered animations using framer-motion or Intersection Observer API while ensuring they perform well across devices."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "SEO and Performance Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the SEO and Performance Optimization task into 6 subtasks covering semantic HTML structure verification, image optimization with next/image, alt text implementation, sitemap and robots.txt generation, Lighthouse testing for all metrics, and issue resolution based on test results.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires technical knowledge across multiple domains (SEO, performance, accessibility) and involves both auditing and fixing issues. The complexity comes from the breadth of knowledge required and the potential need to modify components across the entire site."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Final Testing and Deployment task into 5 subtasks covering build verification and troubleshooting, deployment configuration setup, DNS configuration, cross-browser and device testing, and final content review and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "While this task doesn't involve much new development, it requires thorough testing across multiple browsers and devices, deployment configuration, and DNS setup. The complexity comes from ensuring everything works correctly in the production environment and documenting any issues."
